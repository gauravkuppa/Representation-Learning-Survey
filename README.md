# Visual Representation Learning Paper Survey

The paper survey will follow the issue template and will be located in the 
issues. The goal of this survey is to learn more about representation learning 
in the image domain, and help identify research leads. This is the research 
methodology I take and document.

Below are some relevant papers to read.
